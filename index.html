      <h2>Travel Shot of the Week</h2>
      <p>This week's featured photo is called <a href="#">"Wonka and Wendy Go Rogue"</a>. Its title is a reference to the gentleman's getup and the lady's hair color, per their friends' amused commentary.</p>

      <h2>Classic Pics</h2>
      <p>These throwback shots are from our intrepid photographer's sojourn Down Under, featuring the breathtaking<a href="#"> Kakadu National Forest </a> and some tree ants, which have rear ends that taste like lime. It's true. And slightly spicy.<a href="#"> </a>.</p>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Emily Foley decided to learn about photography when she was in college, and enjoyed sneaking into exclusive events by waving her nice(borrowed) camera and pretending she had a press pass. Now that high-end DSLRs are common and she would actually need a press pass for such a stunt, she focuses her lens on adventures, mainly outdoors and preferably with her partner in crime, Joe.</p>
